## Overview of Election Audit

The purpose of this project is to perform an audit analysis on an election held in Colorodo. The Colorodo election board 
has asked us to perform this analysis for a recent election. There are several key metrics they want to see in the analysis.

  1. Votes cast in this congressional election
  2. The number of votes and the percentage of total votes for each county in the precinct.
  3. County with the largest number of votes
  4. The number of votes and the percentage of the total votes each candidate received.
  5. Which candidate won the election, what was their vote count, and what was their percentage of the total votes.
